# ESP #( 01, 8266, 32 )

***A Common Misconception:*** ESP32 is a successor of ESP
8266 and NodeMcu is firmware that comes installed in a
ESP8266 and uses the Lua programming language but the
ESP8266 that comes with NodeMcu can be reprogrammed via
the Arduino IDE

# Raspberry Pi

## Setup
  - [Download the OS](https://www.raspberrypi.org/downloads/)
    (Raspbian is preferred over NOOBS)
  - Format SD Card with [SD Card Formatter](https://www.sdcard.org/downloads/formatter_4/index.html)
  - Use [Etcher](https://etcher.io) to flash the .iso into the SD Card
  - Insert SD Card into the Pi, connect all peripherals and boot it up
      You are good to go!
